    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Zolile Zoko, a final-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Cape Town. Inspired by the imaginative world of Big Hero 6, my fascination with how technology is crafted from the ground up sparked a deep curiosity that led me to specialize in embedded systems, sensor technologies, and machine learning.

Throughout my studies, I’ve combined creativity with engineering to tackle real-world challenges. For example, I developed an autonomous micromouse robot capable of navigating complex mazes, and I engineered a machine learning-powered RFID weighing platform designed to detect anomalies and support penguin conservation efforts. These projects reflect my commitment not only to advancing technology but also to applying it for meaningful environmental impact.

I’m driven by the belief that innovative engineering can shape a better future, and I’m excited to continue exploring this journey through web development and beyond.</p>
